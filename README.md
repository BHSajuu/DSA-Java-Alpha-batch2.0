# Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Alpha Batch

This repository contains all the Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) code I learned during the **Alpha Batch** taught by **Shradha Ma'am**. It covers a wide range of important DSA topics and problem-solving techniques.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion
- Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Binary Search
- Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashing
- String Manipulation

## Structure of the Repository

Each folder corresponds to a specific DSA topic, and within each folder, you'll find Java code for solving different problems or implementing algorithms related to that topic.
